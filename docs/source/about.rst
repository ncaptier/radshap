LITO laboratory
---------------

`The Laboratory of Translational Imaging in Oncology (LITO) <https://sysbio.curie.fr/>`_ is a mixed research unit supported by Inserm (i.e. French NIH) and Institut Curie, the first cancer center in France. LITO includes about 40 researchers, physicits, engineers, MDs, PharmDs, and technologists and is organized in two research groups with complementary activities: the Biomarkers for Phenotype Imaging group and the Integrated Radiomics for Precision Medicine group.

The Integrated Radiomics for Precision Medicine group takes avantage of PET biomarkers, but also biomarkers from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and computer tomography (CT) and combines them with other types of biomarkers (clinical, pathological, omics, from liquid biopsies) to profile the cancer disease for prognostic or predictive purpose. The models are also developed in such a way that they contribute to a better understanding of cancer-related processes.

The **radshap** package enriches our set of tools dedicated to the analysis of radiological images and the extraction of relevant medical information. It will help us better understand the predictive signatures that we develop and gain more insights about the underlying cancer-related processes.
